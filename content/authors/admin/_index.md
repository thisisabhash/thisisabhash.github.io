#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a Software Development Engineer in the AWS Amplify team.

I relocated to Seattle, WA,  after getting my Masters in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin - Madison in December 2020, where my focus was in Machine Learning and Systems domain. 

I earned my Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani in 2014. Following that, I held Android development roles at Samsung and TiVo, where I developed consumer facing apps in diverse fields like Connected Car (IoT) and Media / Entertainment. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, visiting parks on weekends, playing with my cat and following soccer. Recently, I have been trying my hands on baking too.
